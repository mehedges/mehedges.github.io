I am Madison Hedges (or just "Madi") and I am currently an undergraduate student at Arizona State University. I study Engineering (Electrical Systems) and Space Exploration (Systems Design). I am also in Barrett, the Honors College. I volunteer at the Ronald Greeley Center for Planetary Studies, where I get to organize and file a bunch of cool old space mission records and I work at the Long Wavelength Instrumentation Lab at ISTB4.
